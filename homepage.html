Sh. L.N. Hindu College, Rohtak, previously known as Hindu College, Rohtak, was founded in 1971 by the Hindu Education Society, Rohtak, for providing the value based<br> Education in Arts and Commerce to the growing number of Students of this area. To accommodate more and more Students, the College Management purchased 13 acres of <br>land on Bhiwani Road, Rohtak, on which the foundation stone of the new building was laid by 1008 Swami Gurucharan Dass Ji Maharaj in 1974. Subsequently, the heirs of <br>Shri Lal Nath donated 250 Acres of agricultural land to the Society. Hence, the College was renamed as Sh. L. N. Hindu Colleges Rohtak. The College has now carved out<br> its special lace on the Educational Map of Haryana, It enjoys the reputation of being the premier Institution imparting the quality Education in arts, Commerce,<br> Management and Information Technology. Being run in two separate buildings, one at Bhiwani Stand, Rohtak (only for Girls) and other at Bhiwani Road, <br>Rohtak (Co-Education). Our college is committed to the noble task of developing an all-round personality of the students. To keep pace with the changing times, in the<br> year 2000, the Managing Committee started the professional course like BCA /BBA under self-financing scheme. We have an experienced and a well-qualified team of the <br> dedicated members of the staff. We are proud of the fact that many of our lecturers and students have been selected in IAS, HCS and in reputed Companies of India and<br>Abroad. No doubt, our college has always enjoyed the reputation of having created academically meritorious students. In the Cultural and sports field, too, we have<br> consistently bagged the coveted positions. As a token of recognition of the high-quality performance in all fields of Education, our college was accredited B <br>(CGPA 2.75) Status by NAAC in the year 2016. Fortunately, the College Management is always more than ready to provide the funds and other necessary support for the ful-<br>fillment of the institution’s mission. I must appreciate the efforts and dedication of the staff, both teaching, and non-teaching in achieving our stated<br> goals deserve special mention. I am petty sure that the staff and students of this college will take the institution to the pinnacles of new glory and high competence.
